Unless explicitly stated differently are all changes produced by
Mark Overmeer <mimetypes@overmeer.net>

0.15 Wed Jan 23 21:22:26 CET 2002
	- [Dirk Lutsebaeck] contributed a few mime-types.  I am open
	  to receive more improvements.

	- Refrased the reason for removal of import_mime_types, a
	  residual of the pre-0.10 version of this module.

	- Changed MIME::Type::mainType() into MIME::Type::mediaType() to
          follow the terminology of the RFC more closely.  The old name
	  is still usable.

	- Added MIME::Types::addType

	- Added overloading stringify and comparison to MIME::Type objects.
	  some tests in t/11typeol.t

        - Did a bad job (it's hard to support backwards compat if you run

	Mark Overmeer

	  MIME::Types, such that installation is much easier.
	- Merged-in apache's mime types 1.3.14
	- New test files.
